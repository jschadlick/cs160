Rudimentary speech to text prototype for UC Berkeley cs160 group I/eye prototype of Choreo! application.

Currently:
  -bool flags for 3 different modes:
  	-pre recording
	-post recording
	-comment annotation
 -Annotation currently set to recognize one word at a time, can set up to 4+ by uncommenting the other gb.Appends in CreateSpeechRecognizer()
 	-there is a tradeoff between accuracy and amount of groupable words
 -simple visual testing:
	-in recording modes, labels will appear if command is recognized
	-in annotation, recognized words will appear in text block
	-displays rejection/acceptance of hypothesized word, as well as sureness of guess
 -using word list found at: http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html for annotation vocabulary

 Thank you Nicholas Kong / cs160 discussion section for much of the base code.
